            <h1>What is Hydroponics?</h1>
            <facts>
                <p>
                    Hydroponics comes from the Greek - hydro meaning water, and ponos meaning toil. 'Hydroponics'
                    literally
                    means "working water". In a hydroponic garden, nutrient rich water circulating over plant roots
                    eliminates the need for soil. Water
                    delivers nutrients to the roots rather than the roots doing the work of seeking out and converting
                    nutrients.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Targeting the roots, rather than pouring nutrients and water into the soil where the plant
                    must seek it out, creates a more
                    efficient delivery system. Hydroponically grown plants reach sizes 30 - 50% larger than
                    their traditionally grown counterparts. Scientists believe that
                    because of the easily available oxygen that is delivered directly to the roots, the root system of a
                    hydroponic plant thrives and grows more readily. The plant doesn’t waste its energy searching out
                    nutrients, which are directly provided to the roots multiple times every day, and so the plant has
                    more energy to expend in growing and fruiting.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The plants are also healthier because they face far fewer plant diseases, fungi and pests, as it is
                    much easier to control the environment where there is no soil to harbor pathogens or pests. And it
                    takes a lot less water to grow the plants, since the moisture is directed to the roots, where what
                    is needed
                    is absorbed, and the rest of the nutrient rich water can be recirculated. That means a greater
                    abundance of healthier plants can be grown in smaller areas without wasting water, and without
                    exposing our streams and rivers to pesticides and run off. That’s good for everyone.
