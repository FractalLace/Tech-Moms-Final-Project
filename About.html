            <facts>
                <p>
                    Hydroponics has several advantages over soil gardening. The growth rate on a hydroponic
                    plant
                    is 30-50 percent faster than a soil plant, grown under the same conditions. The yield of the plant
                    is
                    also
                    greater. Scientists believe that there are several reasons for the drastic differences between
                    hydroponic
                    and soil plants. The extra oxygen in the hydroponic growing mediums helps to stimulate root growth.
                    Plants
                    with ample oxygen in the root system also absorb nutrients faster. The nutrients in a hydroponic
                    system
                    are
                    mixed with the water and sent directly to the root system. The plant does not have to search in the
                    soil
                    for
                    the nutrients that it requires. Those nutrients are being delivered to the plant several times per
                    day.
                    The
                    hydroponic plant requires very little energy to find and break down food. The plant then uses this
                    saved
                    energy to grow faster and to produce more fruit. Hydroponic plants also have fewer problems with bug
                    infestations, funguses and disease. In general, plants grown hydroponically are healthier and
                    happier
                    plants.
