            <h1>What is Hydroponics?</h1>
            <facts>
                <p>
                    What is hydroponics? It literally means working the water. It is the process of growing plants
                    without soil, and using water to directly deliver nutrients directly to the roots.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    By directly nourishing the roots of the plant rather than dumping nutrients into the soil where the
                    plant expends a great deal of its energy into searching for them and breaking them down, a more
                    efficient delivery system is created. Hydroponically grown plants reach sizes 30 -50% larger than
                    their traditionally grown counterparts, all other things being equal. Scientists believe that
                    because of the easily available oxygen that is delivered directly to the roots, the root system of a
                    hydroponic plant thrives and grows more readily. The plant doesn’t waste its energy searching out
                    nutrients, which are directly provided to the roots multiple times every day, and so the plant has
                    more energy to expend in growing and fruiting.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The plants are also healthier because they face far fewer plant diseases, fungi and pests, as it is
                    much easier to control the environment, and there is no soil for harboring blights. And it takes a
                    lot less water to grow the plants, since the moisture is directed to the roots, where what is needed
                    is absorbed, and the rest of the nutrient rich water can be recirculated. That means a greater
                    abundance of healthier plants can be grown in smaller areas without wasting water, and without
                    exposing our streams and rivers to pesticides and run off. That’s good for everyone.
